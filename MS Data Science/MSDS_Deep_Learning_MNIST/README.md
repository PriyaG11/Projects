# Foundations of Deep Learning: MNIST Dataset
Enhanced neural network architecture for digit recognition, achieving 85.3% accuracy.
# Project Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that implement and analyze network architectures:

1. **extended_network.ipynb**
2. **original_network.ipynb**

## Notebook Descriptions

### 1. extended_network.ipynb
This notebook includes an implementation and experimentation with an extended version of a network. The main features of the notebook are:

- Contains **12 code cells** implementing the architecture, training, and evaluation of the extended network.
- Focuses on additional layers or modifications to enhance the original network.

### 2. original_network.ipynb
This notebook provides an implementation of the baseline or original network architecture. Key details include:

- Contains **12 code cells** that define, train, and evaluate the original network.
- Serves as a benchmark to compare with the extended network.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, etc.).
2. Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Execute the cells in sequence to replicate the results.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries:
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch (as per implementation)
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Structure

- **extended_network.ipynb**: Contains the extended version of the network.
- **original_network.ipynb**: Provides the implementation of the original network.

## Purpose
The project aims to compare the performance of the extended network against the original network, highlighting improvements or trade-offs introduced by the changes.

## Results
Results and performance metrics can be found in the output sections of each notebook. Please run the notebooks to reproduce these results.
